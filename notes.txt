Potential things to add to model:

Account for injuries/inactity (identify # of weeks injured, find average scoring in weeks they were active, etc.)

Account for magnitude of scoring (Big difference between #1s this year compared to other years - CMC, Lamar, Mike were clear standouts)

Account for overall draft position and finish

Train different models for each position

How to weigh picks (obviously first round more important than 10th - but how to distinguish)

Account for preseason projections - essentially drafting skill (drafting CMC over Saquon would get boosted here)

Which ML algorithm for training? Logistic?

Account for how they did at the end of season more?

Account for handcuffs (ex: Pollard vs. Ekeler)


    #if player['id'] == 3117251:
    #    pprint(player['player']['stats'][0]['appliedTotal'])

Next to dos:

Train by position
Add in overall parameters

Identify potential models and compare their output to inputs, send to participants for evaluation with google form
